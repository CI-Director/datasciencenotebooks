# datasciencenotebooks
I teach a course in data science in NYC with Python, focusing on numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and other technical libraries. The curriculum was built in Google Colab, and all the chapters are made by me and copyright of Code Immersives, where I teach as a data science instructor.
